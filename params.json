It manages both the control connection and the data connection for both client and server implementations.\r\n###[FTPClientSocket](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-FTP/blob/master/FTP%20Sockets/FTPClientSocket.rbbas)\r\nInherits FTPSocket, provides a FTP client. This class provides a number of methods named after the FTP verb they perform. For example, to upload a file the [STOR](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-FTP/blob/master/FTP%20Sockets/FTPClientSocket.rbbas#L439) method is called.\r\n###[FTPServerSocket](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-FTP/blob/master/FTP%20Sockets/FTPServerSocket.rbbas)\r\nInherits FTPSocket, provides a FTP server. This class is incomplete, I would say it's about 50% of the way to working.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project Status\r\nAt the moment, the FTPClientSocket class works and can upload and download files, change directory, etc. The only big thing left on the client socket is parsing LIST responses, which would probably go somewhere in the [FTPSocket.DataAvailableHandler](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-FTP/blob/master/FTP%20Sockets/FTPSocket.rbbas#L134) method which handles the DataAvailable event of the data connection.\r\n\r\nWork on the FTPServerSocket class is still underway.","tagline":"FTP client and server implementations in realbasic"}
